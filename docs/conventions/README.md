# ~ RAPIDEV CONVENTIONS ~


## ~ INTRODUCTION ~

The purpose of this document is to lay out the proper location for any docs regarding the way anything and 
everything should be done when it comes the development of rapidev. In other words, it will serve as a table 
of contents for the conventions documentation directory of the Rapidev package. Note that some information may be 
presented more that once. This is because each section is written as if it is the only source of info available on 
it's topic. This way, you aren't required to skip around in order to understand what you are reading.

## ~ THE PACKAGE ~

### ~ GENERAL PACKAGING CONVENTIONS ~

This directory is to include a file named PKG_CONVENTIONS.md. In this file should be a clear description of any 
rules that we have regarding packaging. It will give a list of deployment targets, along with any significant 
details about each. These will include (but aren't limited to) the path to the repo, the maintainer for that repo, 
and a file list. It will list all of the required files that are dependant on the target. This refers to any file or 
directory that is not in every target's distribution of the package. It will list all such files that pertain to 
that distribution, and it will give a short description of each. Additionally, for each required file, it will list 
any requirements pertaining to formatting, filesize, versioning, required content, etc.
