**ABOUT RAPIDEV DEVELOPER'S TOOLBOX**

The purpose of this open-source software suite is to give software developers a quick and
easy way to ensure that 

  1.) their development environment is set up and tuned for their development tasks,
  1.) they have all of the tools they need for a development project, and
  2.) those tools are properly configured in just the the right way. 
  
The easiest way to put it is to say that:

> The goal of Rapidev is to instantly turn any lilinux system into the ideal dev machine 
> with a single command, and development time is over, to turn it back again with another.

For example, imagine that you have a huge deadline in the morning. you are just finishing up
when your laptop crashes! You go to reboot and.. nothing happens. The battery is fried. Luckily, 
the project is saved to an online repository. Still, you'll need a computer if you are going to 
finish your work.

Your wife tells you that you can use hers if you want, but it isn't a development machine. Sure, it 
could be a dev machine, but that requires a lot of work, and work takes time. You will have to 
download the ide, interpreters / compilers, libraries, etc. You'll need to set up a project folder,
you will need to set a slew of environment variables, you'll need to configure everything, and...
by that time it will be tomorrow morning and youll be late for work, still with no project. If
only there was a way to do it all in one step..

Enter Rapidev. Rapidev is that step.

**PROJECT GOALS**

The core goal of the Rapidev project is to build a software package that provides that command,
but that is not it's only goal. We have other functionality related goals that compliment the 
first. These goals are as follows:

  - the Rapidev Toolbox is modular
  - Users have access to any or all of it's functionalities
  - all tools in the set will be easy to use
  - The tools will have relatively quick run times
  - The naming schemes and abstractions will be consistent across the board
  - The RDT is, and always will be, open-source software

This list of goals is not comprehensive. These goals only relate to the functionalities 
that the RDT exposes. We have goals that relate to other aspects of the Software and project as 
well. These will be included below.

**INSTALLATION**

The RDT will be provided to Linux users primarily through their system's default 
package manager. Our main goal on the Linux Installation front is to make RDT available 
on as many package managers as possible. We will start with Apt and move outward 
from there.  

At first, the RDT will be Linux-only software. However, once we have a "complete" 
Linux solution, we will start development for Windows and Mac systems. These will 
be distributed in the form of a .zip file containing the required installer for each
target system.
